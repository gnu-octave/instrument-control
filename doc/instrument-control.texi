@node Installing and loading
@chapter Installing and loading
@cindex Installing and loading

The Instrument Control toolkit must be installed and then loaded to be used.

It can be installed in @acronym{GNU} Octave directly from octave-forge,
or can be installed in an off-line mode via a downloaded tarball.

The toolkit must be then be loaded once per each @acronym{GNU} Octave session in order to use its functionality.

@section Requirements
@cindex Requirements
For GPIB support (Linux only), linux-gpib must be installed before installing instrument-control. 
GPIB support is also available for windows by following the information from the wiki:
https://wiki.octave.org/Instrument_control_package#Requirements

For VXI11 support, rpcgen, and libtirpc-devel must be installed before installing instrument-control. 


@section Windows install
@cindex Windows install

If using the @acronym{GNU} Octave installer in Windows, the toolkit will have already been installed, and does not need to be re-installed
unless a newer version is available.

Run the following command to verify if the toolkit is available:

@example
pkg list instrument-control
@end example

@section Online Direct install
@cindex Online install
With an internet connection available, toolkit can be installed from
octave-forge using the following command within @acronym{GNU} Octave:

@example
pkg install -forge instrument-control
@end example

The latest released version of the toolkit will be downloaded, compiled and installed.

@section Off-line install
@cindex Off-line install
With the toolkit package already downloaded, and in the current directory when running
@acronym{GNU} Octave, the package can be installed using the following command within @acronym{GNU} Octave:

@example
pkg install instrument-control-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
@end example

@section Loading
@cindex Loading
Regardless of the method of installing the toolkit, in order to use its functions,
the toolkit must be loaded using the pkg load command:

@example
pkg load instrument-control
@end example

The toolkit must be loaded on each @acronym{GNU} Octave session.

@cindex Basic Usage Overview

@node  Authors
@section  Authors
The Instrument control package provides low level I/O functions for serial, i2c, parallel, tcp, gpib, vxi11, udp and usbtmc interfaces.

It was written  mainly by the following developers:

@itemize
@item Andrius Sutas <andrius.sutasg at mail.com>
@item Stefan Mahr <dac922 at gmx.de>
@item John Donoghue <john.donoghue at ieee.org>
@end itemize

@node  Available Interface
@section  Available Interfaces
The ability to use each interface is dependent on OS and what libraries were available during the toolkit install.

To verify the available interfaces, run the following command in octave:

@example
instrhwinfo
@end example

The function will return information on the supported interfaces that are available, similar to below:

@example
    ToolboxVersion = 0.4.0
    ToolboxName = octave instrument control package
    SupportedInterfaces =
    @{
      [1,1] = gpib
      [1,2] = i2c
      [1,3] = parallel
      [1,4] = serial
      [1,5] = tcp
      [1,6] = udp
      [1,7] = usbtmc
      [1,8] = vxi11
    @}
@end example

Most interfaces have two types of functions:

@itemize
@item somewhat compatible matlab functions such as fread, fwrite

@item interface specific lower level functions such as udp_read, udp_write
@end itemize


@node  Basic Serial
@section  Basic Serial

@subsection Serial
The serial object has been depreciated and may not appear in newer versions of the instructment-control toolbox. Instead new code should use the serialport object.

The serial port can be opened using the serial function:

@example
s = serial("/dev/ttyUSB1", 115200) 
@end example

The first parameter is the device name and is OS specific. The second parameter is the baudrate. 

A list of available serial ports can be retrieved using the function:

@example
seriallist
@end example

After creating the interface object, properties of the device can be set or retrieved using get or set functions or as property access.

@example
s = serial("/dev/ttyUSB1", 115200) 
br = get(s, "baudrate") # gets the baudrate
br = s.baudrate  # also gets the baudrate

set(s, "baudrate", 9600) # set the baudrate
s.baudrate = 9600 # also sets the baudrate
@end example

The device can be written and read from using fread, fwrite and srl_read and slr_write functions.

@example
srl_write(s, "hello world") # write hello world
fprintf(s, "hello again")

val = srl_read(s, 10) # attempt to read
val = fread(s, 10)
@end example

The device can be closed using fclose or srl_close.

@example
fclose(s)
@end example

@subsection SerialPort

The recommended method of accessing serial ports is through the serialport object.

The serial port can be opened using the serialport function:

@example
s = serialport("/dev/ttyUSB1", 115200) 
@end example

The first parameter is the device name and is OS specific. The second parameter is the baudrate. 

A list of available serial ports can be retrieved using the function:

@example
serialportlist
@end example

After creating the interface object, properties of the device can be set or retrieved using get or set functions or as property access.

@example
s = serialport("/dev/ttyUSB1", 115200) 
br = get(s, "baudrate") # gets the baudrate
br = s.baudrate  # also gets the baudrate

set(s, "baudrate", 9600) # set the baudrate
s.baudrate = 9600 # also sets the baudrate
@end example

The device can be written and read from using read and write functions.

@example
write(s, "hello world") # write hello world

val = read(s, 10)
@end example

The device can be closed by clearing the serialport object.

@example
clear s
@end example

@node  Basic TCP
@section  Basic TCP
A TCP connection can be opened using the tcp or tcpip function function:

@example
s = tcp("127.0.0.1", 80) 
@end example

The first parameter is the IP address to connect to. The second parameter is the port number. And optional timeout value can be also be provided.

A more matlab compatible function is available as tcpip to also open a tcp port:

@example
s = tcpip("gnu.org", 80) 
@end example

The first  parameter is a hostname or ip address, the second the port number. Additional parameter/value pairs can be provided after the port.


After creating the interface object, properties of the device can be set or retrieved using get or set functions or as property access.

@example
s = tcp("127.0.0.1", 80)
oldtimeout = get(s, "timeout") # get timeout

set(s, "timeout", 10) # set the timeout
s.timeout = oldtimeout # also sets the timeout
@end example

The device can be written and read from using fread, fwrite and tcp_read and tcp_write functions.

@example
tcp_write(s, "HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n")

val = tcp_read(s, 100, 500) # attempt to read 100 bytes
@end example

The device can be closed using fclose or tcp_close.

@example
fclose(s)
@end example
